# How to Use Speaker Notes for Your Presentation

## 🎤 What Are Speaker Notes?

Speaker notes are your **personal reference guide** for the presentation. They're NOT shown to the audience—they're for YOU to glance at while presenting.

## ✅ What to Add to Each Slide

### **Slide 1: What's Done vs. What's Next**
```
"We're launching Nov 15 with GPS compass navigation—not full AR. 
Why? Because I had 3 weeks and needed a working product, not a 
perfect one. This is disciplined execution."

KEY PHRASE: "Phase 1 proves core value. Phase 2 adds advanced 
features based on feedback."
```

### **Slide 2: Why R8,000?**
```
"Without NavEaze, sponsor pays R50k, gets zero data, doesn't renew. 
With NavEaze, organizer pays R8k, gets proof of 237 visits. Sponsor 
renews. Organizer keeps R50k. That's 25.5x ROI."

PAUSE after saying "25.5x ROI" - let it sink in.
```

### **Slide 4: The R200,000 Problem**
```
CRITICAL PHRASE: "Sponsors don't pay for booth space—they pay for 
attention. We measure attention."

Mention Rex Bowden quote: "Event organizers need hard numbers for 
sponsors." That insight pivoted me from navigation app to data platform.
```

### **Slide 5: What I've Built**
```
"610 lines of SQL. Production-grade, not mock data. POPIA/GDPR 
compliant from Day 1. B2B dashboard is live. Mobile app has 3 screens. 
On Nov 15, 500 real students will use it with 10 real booths."

IF ASKED why only 3 screens: "More screens = more bugs = delayed 
launch. I focused on essential value."
```

### **Slide 7: Market Validation**
```
"Three independent signals: AVI JOZI (navigation pain), XDS Canada 
(data need), AWS JHB (tech adoption). When three players point to 
the same gap, it's real."

Early pipeline: "AFDA secured. rAge 2026 next. Target: 3 Gold/Platinum 
organizers Q1 2026."
```

### **Slide 8: Disciplined Execution**
```
"I shipped alone. How? Ruthless prioritization. Phase 1: Database 
(get foundation right). Phase 2: B2B Dashboard (makes money). 
Phase 3: Mobile app (3 screens only). Phase 4: AFDA prep. 
I built essential execution, not perfection."
```

### **Slide 9: Go-to-Market**
```
"Customer = Sponsorship Manager, NOT IT department. They have budget 
authority (R8k is noise), measure by revenue not features, feel the 
pain of R200k losses."

Land & Expand: "R8k first sale → Quicket upsell → R120k/year SaaS = 
R240k lifetime value."
```

### **Slide 10: Strategic Gaps**
```
"Here's what I don't know: How do I reach sponsorship managers at 
Sandton, TicketPro, Gallagher? What's the sales cycle? I need 1-2 
paid pilots Q1 2026 to validate pricing."

CLOSING ASK: "This isn't a funding pitch. This is a request for 
strategic input. Who should I talk to?"
```

## 🔥 Power Phrases (Memorize These - Don't Read Them)

Add these to your notes but **memorize them** so you can say them naturally:

1. "I chose boring solutions to boring problems."
2. "This isn't a school project—this is production-ready code."
3. "Sponsors don't pay for AR animations—they pay for proof."
4. "We charge for outcomes, not features."

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **During Your Presentation:**
1. **Glance, don't read** - Notes are triggers, not scripts
2. **Pause after key numbers** - Let "25.5x ROI" sink in
3. **Make eye contact** - Look at notes between slides, not during
4. **Time yourself** - Each slide should be ~1-1.5 minutes

### **Practice Run:**
1. Go through presentation once with notes visible
2. Second run: Try to present with just 1-2 glances at notes per slide
3. Third run: See if you can do it without notes (but keep them as backup)

### **What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Don't read notes word-for-word (sounds robotic)
- ❌ Don't look down at notes while mid-sentence (breaks flow)
- ❌ Don't put too much text in notes (keep it short triggers)

## 📱 Digital vs. Physical Notes

### **Option 1: Digital (Recommended for Zoom/Virtual)**
- Use presenter view on laptop
- Notes visible to you, slides visible to audience
- Can copy/paste from `SPEAKER_NOTES_QUICK_REF.md`

### **Option 2: Physical (Good for In-Person)**
- Print `SPEAKER_NOTES_QUICK_REF.md` 
- Keep beside you as reference cards
- Highlight key phrases in yellow
- Number pages to match slide order

### **Option 3: Hybrid (Best of Both)**
- Digital notes in presenter view
- Physical 1-page "cheat sheet" with just power phrases
- Glance at physical sheet for confidence boosts
