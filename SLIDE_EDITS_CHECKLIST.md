## 📝 Optional Addition: New Slide 6.5

**Title:** "The MVP Decision Framework"

**Left Column: What I Could Have Built (But Didn't):**
- ❌ Full AR camera navigation with 3D booth markers
- ❌ Real-time attendee chat features
- ❌ AI-powered booth recommendations
- ❌ Gamification with leaderboards

**Right Column: What I Actually Built (And Why):**
- ✅ **GPS compass navigation** - Works reliably, no complex permissions
- ✅ **QR code scanning** - Industry-standard, sponsors understand it
- ✅ **Dwell time tracking** - The ONE metric sponsors care about
- ✅ **Anonymous mode** - Privacy-first, faster launch

**Bottom Box (Key Insight):**
> "I chose boring solutions to boring problems. Sponsors don't pay for AR animations—they pay for proof their booth was visited. Everything else is noise."
