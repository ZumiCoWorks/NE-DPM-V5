## 🎬 30-Second Pitch

> "Event sponsors spend thousands on booths but have zero proof anyone visited. NavEaze solves this with anonymous QR tracking. Attendees scan booth QR codes to navigate - we log every scan. Organizers get instant analytics showing exactly how many people engaged with each sponsor. Microsoft got 108 scans at this demo event. That's 108 attendees who walked to their booth. CSV export ready for sponsor reports. Setup takes 15 minutes. R2,500 per event."
