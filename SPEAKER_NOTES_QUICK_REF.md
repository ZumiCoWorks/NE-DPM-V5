# NavEaze Presentation - Quick Reference Speaker Notes

## 🎤 Opening Hook (30 seconds)

> "Imagine you're a sponsor who just paid R50,000 for a booth at a major event. The event ends. You ask the organizer: 'Did anyone even visit our booth?' They shrug. You don't renew. The organizer loses R200,000 in sponsorships next year. This is the R200,000 problem—and it's happening at every event in South Africa."

---

## Slide-by-Slide Notes

### **Slide 1: What's Done vs. What's Next**

**Key Message:** Phased roadmap shows strategic thinking

**Say:**
> "We're launching Nov 15 with GPS compass navigation—not full AR. Why? Because I had 3 weeks and needed a **working product**, not a perfect one. GPS compass proves the value: navigation + engagement tracking. AR camera overlay can wait for Phase 2 when paying customers fund it. This is disciplined execution."

**Emphasize:**
- Phase 1 (Nov 15): Prove core value with simple tech
- Phase 2 (Dec 2025): Add advanced features based on feedback

---

### **Slide 2: Why R8,000? The ROI Maths**

**Key Message:** We sell outcomes (sponsor retention), not features (fancy tech)

**Say:**
> "Without NavEaze, a sponsor pays R50k, gets zero data, doesn't renew. Organizer loses the sponsorship. With NavEaze, organizer pays R8k, gets a CDV report showing '237 attendees visited BMW booth, avg 4.2 min dwell, 89 QR scans.' Sponsor renews. Organizer keeps R50k. That's a 25.5x ROI on R8k."

**Pause for effect:** Let the 25.5x ROI sink in.

---

### **Slide 4: The R200,000 Problem**

**Key Message:** Sponsors pay for attention, not booth space. We measure attention.

**Say:**
> "The insight came from XDS Canada's Rex Bowden: 'Event organizers need hard numbers for sponsors.' That quote changed everything. I pivoted from building a navigation app to building a **data platform**. Navigation is the hook to get downloads. Engagement data is the value we sell."

**Critical Phrase:** "Sponsors don't pay for booth space—they pay for attention. We measure attention."

---

### **Slide 5: What I've Built: Execution Over Ideas**

**Key Message:** This isn't vapor—it's production-ready code

**Say:**
> "The database is 610 lines of SQL. Not mock data—production-grade schema with POPIA and GDPR compliance baked in from Day 1. The B2B dashboard is live—you can see it right now [show if possible]. The mobile app has 3 screens: event list, booth map, QR scanner. That's it. No bloat. And on Nov 15, I'll have 500 real students using it at AFDA Grad Fest with 10 real booths."

**If Asked:** "Why only 3 screens?"
> "Because more screens = more bugs = delayed launch. I focused on **essential value**: help attendees find booths, track their visits, prove ROI to sponsors. Everything else is noise."

---

### **Slide 7: Market Validation - Why Now?**

**Key Message:** Three independent signals validate this is the right time

**Say:**
> "I didn't guess at market demand. I validated it. AVI JOZI told me attendees struggle to find booths—that's the navigation hook. XDS Canada told me organizers need sponsor metrics—that's the data value. AWS JHB is already using NFC badges for tracking—that's tech adoption proof. When three different industry players point to the same gap, you know it's real."

**Early Pipeline Context:**
> "AFDA Nov 15 is secured—that's my validation event. rAge 2026 is next. Target is 3 Gold/Platinum organizers by Q1 2026. I'm not chasing hundreds of small events. I'm landing **high-value anchor clients** who set the standard."

---

### **Slide 8: Disciplined Execution**

**Key Message:** Solo founder doesn't mean hacking together garbage. It means ruthless prioritization.

**Say:**
> "I shipped alone. No co-founder. No team. No funding. How? I built in phases. Phase 1: Database first—bad data architecture kills you later, so I got it right from Day 1. Phase 2: B2B Dashboard—that's what makes money, so I built that second. Phase 3: Mobile app—as simple as possible, just 3 screens. Phase 4: AFDA pilot prep—QR codes, marketing kit, deployment plan. I didn't try to build everything. I built **essential execution**."

**If Asked:** "Wasn't it risky to build alone?"
> "Actually, it forced clarity. Every feature had to justify its existence. No feature bloat. No consensus delays. Just: Does this help sponsors understand their ROI? If no, cut it."

---

### **Slide 9: Go-to-Market Strategy**

**Key Message:** We sell to revenue teams (who feel the pain), not IT departments (who don't)

**Say:**
> "Our customer is the Sponsorship Manager—the person losing sleep over sponsor renewals. NOT the IT department. Why? Because the Sponsorship Manager has budget authority for small purchases (R8k is noise in their budget), they measure success by revenue not features, and they feel the pain of losing R200k sponsorships."

**Tiered Pricing Logic:**
> "Starter at R2,500 is a decoy. Professional at R8,000 is the anchor—it's psychologically positioned as 'the smart choice.' Enterprise at R25,000 looks expensive until you realize it prevents R200k+ in lost sponsorships."

**Land & Expand:**
> "First sale is R8k for basic CDV reports. Upsell Quicket integration for verified attendee IDs—that's where we prove individual attendees visited booths. Then annual SaaS license at R120k/year for unlimited events. Lifetime value is R240k over 2 years."

---

### **Slide 10: Strategic Gaps & Input Needed**

**Key Message:** I'm self-aware about what I don't know. I need help.

**Say:**
> "Here's what I've built. Here's what I don't know yet. **Commercial validation**: I need 1-2 paid pilots in Q1 2026 to validate R8k pricing with real customers paying real money. **Customer acquisition**: How do I reach sponsorship managers at Sandton Convention Centre, TicketPro Dome, Gallagher? I know they exist. I don't know how to get in front of them. **Sales process**: What's the timeline from demo to contract to payment? I've never sold B2B SaaS before."

**Team Formation:**
> "I need a part-time Sales/BD person post-AFDA (Dec 2025), commission-based at 20% of first sale. And I need a Technical Co-Founder after 3 paid pilots (Q2 2026) with backend scaling and AR/ML expertise. I'm not hiring prematurely—I'm hiring strategically when I have revenue to support it."

**Closing Ask:**
> "This isn't a pitch for funding. This is a request for **strategic input**. Who should I talk to? What's my wedge into convention centers? What am I missing? I've executed solo this far. Now I need guidance to scale smart."

## 🔥 Power Phrases (Memorize These)

1. **On MVP Strategy:**
   > "I chose boring solutions to boring problems. Sponsors don't pay for AR animations—they pay for proof their booth was visited."

2. **On Solo Execution:**
   > "This isn't a school project with mock data. This is production-ready code with real GPS, real QR codes, and real engagement tracking."

3. **On Market Timing:**
   > "When three independent industry players point to the same gap, you know it's real."

4. **On Business Model:**
   > "We charge for outcomes (sponsor retention), not features (fancy tech)."

5. **On Competitive Advantage:**
   > "Our moat isn't technology—it's **commercial execution**. Anyone can build AR navigation. We're the ones actually selling it."

## 🎯 If They Ask...

**"Why didn't you build full AR navigation?"**
> "Because perfect is the enemy of shipped. GPS compass works reliably today. AR camera can be Phase 2 when customers are paying for it. I'm optimizing for **commercial validation**, not technical perfection."

**"How are you different from [competitor]?"**
> "Most event tech focuses on attendee experience. We focus on **organizer outcomes**—specifically, sponsor retention. We're the only ones selling CDV reports as the core product, not navigation features."

**"What if AFDA pilot fails?"**
> "Define failure. If students use the app and I log engagement data, that's success—even if only 50 students participate. I'll have proof of concept for the next pitch. If literally nobody uses it, I learn GPS accuracy needs work, or QR placement was wrong, or marketing sucked. Either way, I iterate."

**"Why not raise funding first?"**
> "Because I don't need it yet. I've built everything so far for near-zero cost using Supabase free tier, Expo free tier, and my own time. Funding makes sense **after** I validate pricing with 3 paying customers. Then I use funding to scale what works, not guess what might work."

**"What's your unfair advantage?"**
> "Speed of execution. I went from idea to working prototype in 3 weeks. I'm a designer who learned to code specifically to ship this. I don't wait for perfection—I iterate in public."

## 🚀 Closing Statement

> "NavEaze isn't just a student project. It's a commercial product launching Nov 15 with a real client, real booths, and real attendees. I've de-risked the tech. I've validated the market. Now I need strategic input to scale smart. Who should I talk to? What's my next move? Let's discuss."
