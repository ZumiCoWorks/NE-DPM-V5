**Body:**

Hey AFDA Fam!

**Grad Fest is in 2 weeks** and I've built something cool for us.

**The Problem:**
Remember last year's Grad Fest? 200+ people, 15 booths, everyone asking "Where's the Animation Studio?"

**The Solution:**
I built **NavEaze** - an AR navigation app that:
- Shows you exactly where every booth is
- Tracks which booths you've visited
- Lets you scan QR codes for exclusive content
- Works on iOS & Android

**Download Here:**
📲 **iOS (TestFlight):** [link]
📱 **Android (Beta):** [link]

**Why You Should Care:**
1. Save time (no wandering around lost)
2. Don't miss booths you care about
3. Support a fellow student's grad project!

This is my final year project and I need YOUR help to make it succeed. 

**See you at Grad Fest on Nov 15!**

Cheers,
[Your Name]
Final Year Student | AFDA 2025

P.S. - This is also launching as a real business in 2026. Early adopters get bragging rights 😎
