## ✂️ What to Cut (Without Killing the Story)

### **Option 1: Strategic Cuts (Recommended)**

**CUT THESE SECTIONS ENTIRELY:**

1. ❌ **Prototype Status slide (1 min)** - This is redundant with "What I Built"
2. ❌ **MVP Framework slide (1.5 min)** - Interesting but not essential
3. ❌ **Go-to-Market detailed tier breakdown (1 min)** - Keep pricing simple

**SHORTEN THESE SECTIONS:**

4. ⏩ **Validation (2.5m → 1.5m)** - Pick TWO signals, not three (cut AWS JHB example)
5. ⏩ **Execution (2.5m → 1.5m)** - Say "4-phase approach" but don't walk through all phases
6. ⏩ **Financials (2m → 1m)** - Show ONE tier example (Professional), mention others exist

**Total time saved: ~6 minutes**  
**New total: 14-15 minutes** ✅

---

### **Option 2: Aggressive Cuts (If Needed)**

If you're STILL running long, also cut:

7. ❌ **Pivot slide (1.5 min)** - Merge into validation ("I pivoted based on Rex's advice")
8. ⏩ **Strategic Gaps (2.5m → 1m)** - State the gaps, don't explain them

**Total time saved: ~8 minutes**  
**New total: 12-13 minutes** ✅✅

---

## 🎯 15-Minute Version (Recommended Flow)

### **1. Opening (45s)**
> "Event organizers collect data but can't connect it. When sponsors ask 'did VIPs engage?', they can't answer. No proof = no renewal. Organizers lose R200k. NavEaze solves this."

---

### **2. Problem Context (1 min)**
Brief competitive landscape:
> "NFC badges exist but cost R50+ per attendee. Lead scanners exist but only track sponsor scans. We integrate ticket data with engagement data at 1/10th the cost."

---

### **3. Market Validation (1.5 min)**
**Pick TWO signals, not three:**
- ✅ AVI JOZI (navigation pain is real)
- ✅ Rex Bowden (focus on metrics)
- ❌ AWS JHB (cut this)

---

### **4. What I've Built (2 min)**
Keep this—it's your proof of execution.

---

### **5. ~~Prototype Status~~ (SKIP)**
Redundant with "What I Built"

---

### **6. Execution Highlights (1.5 min)**
**Don't walk through all 4 phases.** Instead:
> "I shipped this in 3 weeks through disciplined phasing: Database first, then B2B dashboard, then mobile app, then AFDA prep. I faced setbacks—database migration failed, AR camera too complex, Quicket auth deferred. Learning: Ship MVP first, add complexity after validation."

---

### **7. ~~MVP Framework~~ (SKIP)**
Interesting but not essential. Save for Q&A if asked.

---

### **8. Pricing & ROI (1.5 min)**
Simplify to ONE example:
> "We start at R2,500 for small events like AFDA—that's a 20x ROI to prevent R50k sponsor loss. As events grow, they upgrade to R8,000 Professional or R25,000 Enterprise. We're profitable at every tier with margins from 15% to 81%."

**Don't show the full tier breakdown unless asked.**

---

### **9. ~~Financials Deep Dive~~ (SIMPLIFY to 1 min)**
**Don't show all three tiers.** Instead:
> "Unit economics: Our target Professional tier generates R8,000 revenue, R2,858 variable cost, R5,142 profit—that's a 64% margin. We break even at 23 events per month. At 40 events, we're at R150k monthly profit."

---

### **10. ~~Go-to-Market Details~~ (SHORTEN to 1 min)**
Keep it high-level:
> "Target customer: Revenue Teams, specifically Sponsorship Managers. They own the ROI problem and have budget authority. R8k is budget dust compared to R200k in lost renewals. Land & Expand: Start at R2.5k Starter, migrate to R8k Professional, upsell to annual licenses."

**Skip the detailed tier psychology.**

---

### **11. What's Done vs. What's Next (1.5 min)**
Keep this—shows clear objectives.

---

### **12. Strategic Gaps (1.5 min)**
State them, don't explain them:
> "Three gaps where I need help: Technical—GPS accuracy and app deployment. Commercial—how do I reach sponsorship managers? Team—when do I hire Sales/BD vs Technical Co-Founder? I'll have answers by Nov 20th after AFDA."

---

### **13. Closing (1 min)**
Keep this—strong finish.

## 🎯 What You're Cutting (and Why It's OK)

### **Prototype Status Slide**
**Why cut:** Redundant. "What I Built" already covers this.  
**If asked:** "Yes, it's live. B2B dashboard deployed, mobile app ready for TestFlight Nov 15."

---

### **MVP Framework Slide**
**Why cut:** Interesting but not essential for proving business viability.  
**If asked:** "I chose boring solutions over flashy tech. GPS compass works, AR camera deferred to Phase 2. Dwell time matters, gamification doesn't."

---

### **Go-to-Market Details**
**Why cut:** The tier psychology is cool but not critical.  
**If asked:** "We have 3 tiers: R2.5k Starter, R8k Professional, R25k Enterprise. Starter gets customers in, Professional drives profit, Enterprise scales margins."

---

### **Detailed Financial Breakdown**
**Why cut:** Showing all 3 tiers with variable costs is too much detail.  
**If asked:** "Variable costs scale from R2.1k to R4.8k depending on event size, but revenue scales faster. That's why margins improve from 15% to 81%."

---

## 📋 Quick Checklist

**Before you present, DECIDE:**

- [ ] Am I using the **15-minute version** (cuts above) or **full version**?
- [ ] If 15-min version: Remove Prototype Status slide from deck
- [ ] If 15-min version: Remove MVP Framework slide from deck
- [ ] If 15-min version: Simplify Financials slide to show ONLY Professional tier
- [ ] Practice with timer: Does it fit in 14 minutes?

---

## 💡 Pro Tip: The "Parking Lot" Strategy

**When cutting sections, say:**
> "I have detailed breakdowns of [topic] available—happy to dive into that in Q&A or share the deck afterward."

**This:**
1. Shows you have depth
2. Acknowledges you're being concise
3. Invites engagement in Q&A
4. Doesn't look like you're hiding anything

---

## 🚨 Red Flag: If You're Still Running Long

**If you practice and you're STILL over 15 minutes:**

### **Nuclear Option: Cut The Pivot Slide**
Merge it into validation:
> "I started with a DPM platform, too broad. Rex Bowden told me 'focus on quantifiable metrics.' That changed everything. I pivoted to engagement data as the core value, navigation as the hook."

**This saves another 1 minute.**

---

## ✅ Final Reality Check

**Practice out loud with a timer RIGHT NOW.**

If you're at:
- **12-14 minutes:** Perfect ✅
- **15-16 minutes:** Cut one more section ⚠️
- **17+ minutes:** Use aggressive cuts ❌

**The worst thing you can do is run over time and get cut off mid-sentence during Strategic Gaps or Closing.** Better to cut content yourself than have them cut you off.

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**You have great content, but too much of it.**

**Cut ruthlessly. Keep the story:**
1. Problem (R200k lost)
2. What I built (610 lines SQL, working code)
3. Unit economics (64% margin)
4. What I need help with (customer acquisition)

**Everything else is supporting detail.** If they want more, they'll ask in Q&A.

**Now go practice with a timer and see where you land.** ⏱️
