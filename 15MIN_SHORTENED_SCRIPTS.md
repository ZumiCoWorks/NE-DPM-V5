# 15-Minute Version - Shortened Scripts

**Use these instead of the full speaker notes when you need to save time.**

## ✂️ Validation (Full: 2.5m → Short: 1.5m)

### **FULL VERSION (DON'T USE):**
> "Three key signals told me this was the right pivot: First, the hook is validated. At AVI JOZI... [3 detailed stories]"

### **SHORT VERSION (USE THIS):**
> "Two validation signals: At AVI JOZI, I watched attendees struggle to find exhibitors—navigation is a real pain. Rex Bowden from XDS Canada told me 'focus on quantifiable metrics'—engagement data is what organizers will pay for. The hook gets downloads, the data gets revenue. AFDA pilot is secured for Nov 15, targeting 3 paying customers by Q1 2026."

## ✂️ Execution (Full: 2.5m → Short: 1.5m)

### **FULL VERSION (DON'T USE):**
> "Let me walk you through how I actually shipped this in 3 weeks. Phase 1: Database Schema... [walks through all 4 phases in detail]"

### **SHORT VERSION (USE THIS):**
> "I shipped this in 3 weeks through disciplined phasing: Database first, B2B dashboard second, mobile app third, AFDA prep fourth. I faced setbacks—database migration failed, AR camera too complex, Quicket auth too slow. Learning: Ship MVP first, add complexity after validation. Everything you see today is working code, not mockups."

## ✂️ Pricing & ROI (Full: 2m → Short: 1.5m)

### **FULL VERSION (DON'T USE):**
> "Here's the value proposition in numbers. Scenario WITHOUT NavEaze... [detailed before/after with multiple sponsors]"

### **SHORT VERSION (USE THIS):**
> "The ROI math: Organizers pay R2,500 for small events like AFDA to prevent a R50,000 sponsor loss—that's 20x ROI. As events grow, they upgrade to R8,000 Professional or R25,000 Enterprise. We're profitable at every tier with margins from 15% to 81%. The bigger they grow, the more profitable we both get."

**Time saved: 30 seconds**

## ✂️ Financials (Full: 2m → Short: 1m)

### **FULL VERSION (DON'T USE):**
> "Here's the unit economics across our three tiers: Starter... Professional... Enterprise... [shows all 3 with detailed breakdowns]"

### **SHORT VERSION (USE THIS):**
> "Unit economics for our target Professional tier: R8,000 revenue, R2,858 variable cost, R5,142 profit—64% margin. We break even at 23 events per month. At 40 events, R150k monthly profit. Variable costs scale with event size, but revenue scales faster—that's why margins improve as customers grow."

**Time saved: 1 minute**

## ✂️ Go-to-Market (Full: 2m → Short: 1m)

### **FULL VERSION (DON'T USE):**
> "Target customer: Revenue Teams, specifically Sponsorship Managers... [detailed psychology, tier breakdown, Land & Expand with all details]"

### **SHORT VERSION (USE THIS):**
> "Target customer: Sponsorship Managers at venues like Sandton Convention Centre, TicketPro Dome, Gallagher. They own the ROI problem and have budget authority. R8k is budget dust compared to R200k in lost renewals. Land & Expand: Start affordable, upsell as they grow. Lifetime value: R50k+ over 2 years. The gap I need help with: How do I reach these people? Cold email, LinkedIn, or hire a rep?"

**Time saved: 1 minute**

## ✂️ Strategic Gaps (Full: 2.5m → Short: 1.5m)

### **FULL VERSION (DON'T USE):**
> "Here are the areas where I need investor attention or input: 1. Technical Execution Challenges... [explains each in detail with context]"

### **SHORT VERSION (USE THIS):**
> "Three gaps where I need input: Technical—GPS accuracy indoors and first-time app deployment. Commercial—how do I reach sponsorship managers and what's the sales timeline? Team—when do I hire Sales/BD versus Technical Co-Founder? I'll have answers by Nov 20th, five days after the AFDA pilot. That's when I'll know if this is viable or if I need to pivot."

**Time saved: 1 minute**

## ❌ SKIP ENTIRELY: Prototype Status

### **WHAT TO SAY INSTEAD (10 seconds):**
If someone asks "What's the status of the build?":
> "It's live. B2B dashboard deployed, database in production, mobile app ready for TestFlight launch on Nov 15."

---

## ❌ SKIP ENTIRELY: MVP Framework

### **WHAT TO SAY INSTEAD (15 seconds):**
If someone asks "Why didn't you build X feature?":
> "I chose boring solutions over flashy tech. GPS compass works today, AR camera is Phase 2. QR codes are industry-standard, gamification isn't. Dwell time is what sponsors pay for—everything else is noise."

## 💡 The "Speed Through" Technique

**If you realize you're running long mid-presentation:**

### **For any slide, you can say:**
> "I have detailed breakdowns here, but in the interest of time: [ONE KEY POINT]. Happy to dive deeper in Q&A."

**Examples:**

**Validation:**
> "In the interest of time: Two key validations—navigation pain is real (AVI JOZI), engagement data sells (Rex Bowden). AFDA secured for Nov 15."

**Execution:**
> "Quick execution summary: 4-phase approach, shipped in 3 weeks, faced setbacks but kept shipping. Key learning: MVP first, complexity later."

**Financials:**
> "Quick unit economics: 64% margin on Professional tier, break even at 23 events per month. Variable costs scale but revenue scales faster."

## ⏱️ Time Check Points

**Set mental checkpoints:**

| Checkpoint | Time | Where You Should Be |
|------------|------|---------------------|
| 5 min | ⏰ | Finishing Validation |
| 8 min | ⏰ | Finishing Execution |
| 10 min | ⏰ | Finishing Financials |
| 12 min | ⏰ | Starting Strategic Gaps |
| 14 min | ⏰ | Starting Closing |

**If you're behind at ANY checkpoint, switch to short versions.**

## 🚨 Emergency "I'm Running Long" Plan

**If you hit 10 minutes and you're only at Pricing:**

1. **Speed through Financials (30s):** "64% margin, break even at 23 events, R150k profit at scale."
2. **Speed through Go-to-Market (30s):** "Targeting sponsorship managers, R8k is budget dust, need help with customer acquisition."
3. **Speed through What's Next (45s):** "AFDA Nov 15, TestFlight Oct 31, AR-Lite in Dec."
4. **Keep Strategic Gaps (1.5m):** This is critical—shows you know what you don't know.
5. **Keep Closing (1m):** Strong finish matters.

**Total remaining: 4.5 minutes**  
**You finish at 14.5 minutes** ✅

## ✅ Practice Protocol

**Before tomorrow:**

1. **Practice FULL version once** (see how long it takes)
2. **Practice SHORT version twice** (use these scripts)
3. **Practice EMERGENCY version once** (see above)

**Then you'll have:**
- ✅ Plan A: Short version (14-15 min)
- ✅ Plan B: Emergency version (13-14 min)
- ✅ Plan C: Can adapt mid-presentation if needed

---

**Now go time yourself. You'll feel WAY more confident knowing you can flex in real-time.** ⏱️🎯
