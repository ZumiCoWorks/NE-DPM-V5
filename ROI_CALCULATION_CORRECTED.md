# ROI Calculation Corrected

## ❓ Where Did 25.5x Come From?

**The old calculation:**
- Organizer pays: R8,000
- Total sponsors at risk: 4 sponsors × R51,000 each = R204,000
- ROI: R204,000 ÷ R8,000 = **25.5x**

**But this has TWO problems:**

---

## ❌ Problem 1: The Math Doesn't Match The Story

### **In the presentation, you say:**
> "The organizer just lost R200,000 in next year's sponsorships"

### **But the 25.5x calculation assumes:**
> "The organizer saves R204,000"

**Where did R204,000 come from?**
- R200,000 ÷ R8,000 = 25x (not 25.5x)
- R204,000 ÷ R8,000 = 25.5x ✓

It looks like someone used R51,000 per sponsor (not R50,000) to get to 25.5x. This is inconsistent.

---

## ❌ Problem 2: The Pricing Is Wrong For AFDA

### **You're now saying:**
> "AFDA is a Starter tier event (R2,500), not Professional tier (R8,000)"

**So the ROI calculation should be based on R2,500, not R8,000.**

---

## ✅ Corrected ROI Calculations

### **Option 1: Single Sponsor ROI (Most Conservative)**

**Scenario:** Organizer prevents losing ONE sponsor

| Tier | Price | Sponsor Saved | ROI |
|------|-------|---------------|-----|
| Starter | R2,500 | R50,000 | **20x** |
| Professional | R8,000 | R50,000 | **6.25x** |
| Enterprise | R25,000 | R50,000 | **2x** |

**This is the most defensible because:**
- ✅ Conservative (only counts 1 sponsor)
- ✅ Easy to prove (just need 1 renewal to justify cost)
- ✅ Strongest for Starter tier (20x is better than 6.25x)

---

### **Option 2: Multiple Sponsor ROI (More Aggressive)**

**Scenario:** Organizer prevents losing ALL sponsors (typically 4-5 per event)

| Tier | Price | Sponsors Saved | Total Value | ROI |
|------|-------|----------------|-------------|-----|
| Starter | R2,500 | 4 × R50k | R200,000 | **80x** |
| Professional | R8,000 | 4 × R50k | R200,000 | **25x** |
| Enterprise | R25,000 | 4 × R50k | R200,000 | **8x** |

**This is more aggressive because:**
- ⚠️ Assumes NavEaze helps renew ALL sponsors (harder to prove)
- ⚠️ Less conservative, may raise eyebrows
- ✅ But still mathematically accurate

---

## 🎯 Recommended Approach: Hybrid

### **What To Say:**

> "Here's the ROI: An organizer pays R2,500 for a small event like AFDA. If NavEaze helps renew even ONE R50,000 sponsor, that's a 20x return. But most events have 4-5 sponsors. If NavEaze helps renew all of them, we're talking R200,000 in retained revenue for a R2,500 investment—that's an 80x return. Even if we only help renew half, it's 40x. The investment pays for itself if we save just one sponsor renewal."

**Why this works:**
1. Starts with conservative case (20x for 1 sponsor)
2. Shows upside potential (80x if all renew)
3. Acknowledges middle ground (40x if half renew)
4. Ends with strong closing line ("pays for itself with just one")

## 🎤 Updated Speaker Notes

### **For Pricing/ROI Slide:**

**SAY:**
> "Here's the ROI math. For a small event like AFDA, the organizer pays R2,500. If NavEaze helps renew even ONE R50,000 sponsor, that's a 20x return. Just one sponsor pays for it.
>
> But here's the upside: most events have 4-5 sponsors. If NavEaze helps renew all of them, we're talking R200,000 in retained revenue for a R2,500 investment—that's an 80x return. Even if we only help with half, it's a 40x return.
>
> The key point: The investment pays for itself if we save just one sponsor renewal. Everything beyond that is pure upside."

**Pause after "80x return" - let it land.**

## 🚨 What NOT To Say Anymore

### **❌ OLD (Inconsistent):**
> "That's a 25.5x ROI on R8k."

**Problems:**
1. Where did 25.5x come from? (R204k ÷ R8k, but you say R200k problem)
2. Why R8k for AFDA when it's Starter tier (R2.5k)?
3. Math doesn't match the narrative

### **✅ NEW (Consistent):**
> "That's a 20x ROI on R2.5k for one sponsor, or 80x if it helps renew all 4-5 sponsors."

**Why better:**
1. Math is clear and defensible
2. Matches AFDA pricing (Starter tier)
3. Shows conservative AND optimistic scenarios
4. Stronger ROI (20x > 6.25x, 80x > 25.5x)

## ✅ Quick Fix For Tomorrow

**Just memorize this:**

> "R2,500 prevents R50,000 loss = 20x ROI. If it helps renew all 4-5 sponsors (R200k total), that's 80x ROI. Investment pays for itself with just one sponsor."

**Don't mention 25.5x at all.**

---

## 💡 Why 80x Is Better Than 25.5x

1. **Mathematically sound:** R200,000 ÷ R2,500 = 80x ✓
2. **Matches AFDA pricing:** Uses Starter tier, not Professional
3. **More impressive:** 80x > 25.5x
4. **More conservative base case:** Starts with 20x (1 sponsor) instead of 25x (all sponsors)
5. **Clear range:** "20x to 80x depending on renewals" is clearer than "25.5x"

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**The 25.5x calculation came from:**
- R204,000 (4 sponsors × R51,000) ÷ R8,000 = 25.5x
- But this doesn't match your R200k narrative
- And it uses wrong pricing tier for AFDA (R8k instead of R2.5k)

**Use this instead:**
- **Conservative:** R2,500 saves 1 sponsor (R50k) = 20x ROI
- **Realistic:** R2,500 saves 2-3 sponsors (R100-150k) = 40-60x ROI  
- **Optimistic:** R2,500 saves 4-5 sponsors (R200-250k) = 80-100x ROI

**Memorize:** "20x to 80x depending on how many sponsors renew. Pays for itself with just one."

**This is now mathematically consistent, uses correct pricing, and is actually MORE impressive.** 🎯
