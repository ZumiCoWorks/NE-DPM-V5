## 💬 Power Phrases (Use These)

**Opening:**
> "Event organizers have data, not insights. We connect the dots."

**Problem:**
> "Sponsors don't pay for booth space—they pay for attention. We measure attention."

**Pivot:**
> "Focus on commercial pain first, then build technology to solve it."

**Competition:**
> "NFC costs R50+ per attendee. We're R8k flat. We're 1/10th the cost for better data."

**Pricing:**
> "We start at R2,500 for small events to prove value. As events grow, they upgrade to R8k Professional (64% margin) or R25k Enterprise (81% margin). Starter is the hook, Professional is the profit."

**Unit Economics:**
> "Variable costs scale with event size—R2.1k for Starter, R2.9k for Professional, R4.8k for Enterprise. But revenue scales faster. Margins improve from 15% to 64% to 81%. We're profitable at every tier."

**MVP Philosophy:**
> "We charge for outcomes, not features. Boring solutions that work pay the bills."

**Setbacks:**
> "Ship working MVP first, add complexity after validation."

**Gaps:**
> "I can build—I've proven that. Now I need to prove I can sell."

**Closing:**
> "I'll have answers by Nov 20th. That's how I'll know if this is viable or if I pivot."

## ❓ Q&A Quick Responses

**"What if AFDA fails?"**
→ "Then I have a validated case study of what NOT to do. I pivot fast. I spent R500 and 3 weeks—low risk, maximum learning."

**"How do you compete with NFC?"**
→ "We're 1/10th the cost. NFC tracks presence, we track engagement. We're not competing for enterprise—we win mid-tier events that can't afford NFC."

**"Privacy concerns?"**
→ "POPIA/GDPR compliance built in from Day 1. Anonymous mode available. Explicit consent for ticket linking. Privacy is a core feature, not an afterthought."

**"What if Quicket builds this?"**
→ "Quicket sells tickets—that's their core business. We integrate WITH Quicket, not compete. We actually increase their value."

**"Biggest risk?"**
→ "Customer acquisition. I can build—proven. But haven't proven I can sell B2B SaaS. That's why Nov 15 is critical—social proof."

**"Are you profitable?"**
→ "Not yet—zero paying customers. But unit economics are sound: 64% margin. At 2 events/month I cover living expenses. At 10 events/month, R50k profit."

**"No technical co-founder?"**
→ "I keep building myself. I've proven I can ship. The real blocker is sales—I'd rather find a Sales Co-Founder right now."

## 🎯 Opening Line (Memorize This)

"Good morning. I'm Tlotlo Molope, founder of NavEaze. Today I'm sharing what I've built in the past 3 weeks, what I've learned, and what I need help with to scale this business. This is a results-focused update—I'll show you working code, real financials, and honest gaps."

---

## 🎯 Closing Line (Memorize This)

"To summarize: I've proven I can ship—610 lines of SQL, working dashboard, mobile app—in 3 weeks, alone. The problem is real, the solution is validated. On Nov 15, I'm testing whether 500 students will use it and whether organizers will pay R8,000 after seeing results. I'll have answers by Nov 20th. That's how I'll know if this is viable or if I need to pivot again. Thank you—happy to take questions."
