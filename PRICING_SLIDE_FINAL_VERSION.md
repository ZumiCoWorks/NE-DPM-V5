(Avoid "Why R2,500?" or "Why R8,000?" since you have 3 tiers)

---

## 🎤 What To Say (1.5 minutes)

### **Opening (15 seconds):**

"Let me show you why event organizers will pay for this. It comes down to ROI math."

---

### **The Problem - Fragmented Data (30 seconds):**

"Here's the situation organizers face today:

They have ticket data in Quicket. They might have foot traffic numbers from NFC badges. They have sponsor leads in a spreadsheet. But when a R50,000 sponsor asks **'Did VIP ticket holders engage with our booth?'**—they can't answer. 

They have data—lots of it—but it's **fragmented**. They can't connect ticket identity to engagement behavior. No proof of ROI means the sponsor doesn't renew."

**Pause.**

---

### **The Consequences (15 seconds):**

"Losing one R50,000 sponsor is bad. But most events have 4-5 sponsors. That's R200,000+ at risk every year because organizers can't prove value."

---

### **The Solution - Integration (30 seconds):**

"NavEaze solves the integration problem. We connect Quicket ticket data to our engagement tracking. Now when that sponsor asks 'did VIPs engage?', the organizer shows them a report:

**'237 attendees visited your booth. 89 were VIP ticket holders. Average dwell time: 4.2 minutes. 89 QR code scans showing active interest.'**

That's not just data—that's **proof**."

**Pause.**

---

### **The ROI Math (20 seconds):**

"Here's what that's worth:

For a small event like AFDA—500 attendees, 15 booths—the organizer pays **R2,500** for our Starter package.

If NavEaze helps renew even **ONE** R50,000 sponsor, that's a **20x return**.

But most events have 4-5 sponsors worth R200,000 total. If we help renew all of them, that's an **80x return**."

**Pause after "80x return" - let it land.**

---

### **The Closer (10 seconds):**

"The key insight: The investment pays for itself if we save just one sponsor renewal. Everything beyond that is pure upside.

And as events grow—more attendees, more booths, more sponsors—they upgrade to our R8,000 Professional tier or R25,000 Enterprise tier. We grow with them."

**Personally, I'd use Option 2** (Simple ROI Table) - it's clearest and most impactful.

## 🎯 Key Messaging Changes

### **❌ OLD (Wrong):**
> "Sponsors get zero data. They shrug."

### **✅ NEW (Correct):**
> "Organizers have data but it's fragmented. They can't connect ticket identity to engagement."

---

### **❌ OLD (Wrong):**
> "Pay R8,000 to prevent R50,000 loss = 6.25x ROI"

### **✅ NEW (Correct):**
> "Pay R2,500 to prevent at least R50,000 loss = 20x ROI. Full upside: R200,000 saved = 80x ROI."

---

### **❌ OLD (Wrong):**
> "No one measures event engagement."

### **✅ NEW (Correct):**
> "NFC badges measure foot traffic. Lead scanners measure booth scans. But neither connects to ticket identity. We're the integration layer."

---

## 💡 Why This Version Is Stronger

1. ✅ **Acknowledges competitors** (shows you know the market)
2. ✅ **Clear differentiation** (integration vs. isolated data)
3. ✅ **Conservative base case** (20x for 1 sponsor is defensible)
4. ✅ **Clear upside** (80x if all sponsors renew)
5. ✅ **Strong closer** ("pays for itself with just one")
6. ✅ **Matches AFDA pricing** (R2,500 Starter, not R8,000)
7. ✅ **Mathematically sound** (R200k ÷ R2.5k = 80x, clean)

---

## 🚨 What NOT To Say

### **Don't Say:**
- ❌ "Organizers have no data" (they do, it's fragmented)
- ❌ "25.5x ROI" (old math, doesn't match narrative)
- ❌ "R8,000 for AFDA" (wrong tier)
- ❌ "We're the first to measure engagement" (false, NFC exists)

### **Do Say:**
- ✅ "Organizers have fragmented data they can't connect"
- ✅ "20x to 80x ROI depending on renewals"
- ✅ "R2,500 for Starter tier like AFDA"
- ✅ "We're the first to integrate ticket data with engagement"

## 📋 Cheat Sheet for This Slide

**Copy this to a notecard:**

> **THE PROBLEM:** Fragmented data (Quicket + NFC + spreadsheets). Can't answer "did VIPs engage?"
>
> **THE CONSEQUENCE:** Lose R50k-R200k in sponsor renewals
>
> **THE SOLUTION:** NavEaze integrates ticket identity + engagement = proof of ROI
>
> **THE MATH:** R2,500 investment. Save 1 sponsor = 20x. Save all 4-5 = 80x.
>
> **THE CLOSER:** "Pays for itself with just one renewal."

## ⏱️ If You're Running Short On Time (45-second version):

> "Quick ROI math: Event organizers have data but it's fragmented—Quicket tickets, NFC foot traffic, leads in spreadsheets. When a R50,000 sponsor asks 'did VIPs engage?', they can't connect the dots. NavEaze integrates ticket identity with engagement tracking. For R2,500, organizers get proof that prevents losing R50,000 to R200,000 in sponsor renewals. That's 20x to 80x ROI. Investment pays for itself with just one renewal."

## ✅ Final Version for Speaker Notes

**This is what should be in `SPEAKER_NOTES_COMPLETE.md` under the Pricing slide:**

### **Slide 9: The ROI Math (1.5 minutes)**

**[Slide: The ROI Math: Why Organizers Pay]**

"Let me show you why event organizers will pay for this. It comes down to ROI math.

Here's the situation organizers face today: They have ticket data in Quicket. They might have foot traffic numbers from NFC badges. They have sponsor leads in a spreadsheet. But when a R50,000 sponsor asks **'Did VIP ticket holders engage with our booth?'**—they can't answer. They have data—lots of it—but it's **fragmented**. They can't connect ticket identity to engagement behavior. No proof of ROI means the sponsor doesn't renew.

**[Pause]**

Losing one R50,000 sponsor is bad. But most events have 4-5 sponsors. That's R200,000+ at risk every year because organizers can't prove value.

NavEaze solves the integration problem. We connect Quicket ticket data to our engagement tracking. Now when that sponsor asks 'did VIPs engage?', the organizer shows them a report:

**'237 attendees visited your booth. 89 were VIP ticket holders. Average dwell time: 4.2 minutes. 89 QR code scans showing active interest.'**

That's not just data—that's **proof**.

**[Pause]**

Here's what that's worth: For a small event like AFDA—500 attendees, 15 booths—the organizer pays **R2,500** for our Starter package. If NavEaze helps renew even **ONE** R50,000 sponsor, that's a **20x return**. But most events have 4-5 sponsors worth R200,000 total. If we help renew all of them, that's an **80x return**.

**[Pause after "80x return" - let it land]**

The key insight: The investment pays for itself if we save just one sponsor renewal. Everything beyond that is pure upside. And as events grow—more attendees, more booths, more sponsors—they upgrade to our R8,000 Professional tier or R25,000 Enterprise tier. We grow with them."
