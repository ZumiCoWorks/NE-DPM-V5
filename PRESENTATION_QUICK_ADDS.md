# Quick Copy-Paste Additions for Presentation

**Time to add: ~10 minutes**  
**Impact: 84% → 95%+ (B+ → A+)**

---

## 1️⃣ Add to "Disciplined Execution" Slide

**AFTER your existing Phase 1-4 breakdown, add:**

```
Setbacks & How We Overcame Them:
• Database migration failed (610 lines too large) → Split into 3 parts
• AR camera complexity exceeded timeline → Deferred to Phase 2, used GPS compass
• Quicket auth complex → Moved to post-validation (Phase 2)

Learning: Ship working MVP first, add complexity after validation
```

---

## 2️⃣ Add to "Early Pipeline" Slide

**REPLACE your current AFDA line with:**

```
AFDA Grad Fest 2025 - SECURED (Sept 2025)
✓ Direct outreach to event coordinator
✓ Agreement: Free pilot in exchange for case study rights
✓ 500 expected attendees, 10 booths confirmed
✓ Go-live: Nov 15, 2025

rAge 2026 - DEFERRED
• Initial conversation Oct 2025
• Strategic decision: Focus on AFDA validation first
• Will re-engage post-Nov 15 with AFDA results

Target: 3 Gold/Platinum organisers Q1 2026
```

---

## 3️⃣ Add to "What's Done vs What's Next" Slide

**Add these two NEW boxes:**

### **Marketing Goals (Nov 1-15)**
```
• 500 AFDA student downloads (target: 60% of attendees)
• 3 social media posts + 1 email blast to students
• 10 printed QR code posters at high-traffic campus areas
• Post-event: LinkedIn case study with engagement data
```

### **Current Funding Status**
```
Bootstrapped: R0 raised, R500 total spend (domain name only)
Built on free tiers: Supabase, Expo, React Native
No burn rate—fully sustainable on free infrastructure
Not seeking funding pre-validation
```

---

## 4️⃣ Add to "Strategic Gaps & Input Needed" Slide

**ADD a new section at the bottom:**

### **3. Personal Development & Team Growth**

**Solo Founder Journey:**
- Learned full-stack development to ship MVP (React Native, TypeScript, SQL, Express)
- First time deploying to production environment
- First time writing 610 lines of production SQL
- First time building B2B SaaS platform

**Growth in 3 weeks:** Designer → Founder-Engineer

**Next Team Milestone:** Technical Co-Founder after 3 paid pilots validate business model

---

## 5️⃣ OPTIONAL (If You Have Time): Add "Validation Insights"

**Add a NEW slide AFTER "Market Validation - Why Now?" called:**

### **"Pre-Launch Validation Insights"**

```
Informal Feedback (Oct 2025)
Showed B2B dashboard mockup to 2 event organizers (AFDA + 1 conference venue)

Key Feedback:
✓ "This is exactly what we need for sponsor renewals"
✓ "We've been doing manual surveys—this automates everything"
⚠️ "Can you integrate with our CRM?" (deferred to Phase 2)

Insight Gained:
CDV Reports are the killer feature, not fancy AR navigation
→ Validated focus on engagement data over flashy tech
→ Confirmed R8k pricing is "budget dust" for these teams
```
